**Course:** Data Mining Final Project  
**Goal:** Explore how Spotify listening preferences and music mood (valence) change across seasons.

## Project Overview

This project investigates whether **people listen to happier music in summer and sadder music in autumn/winter**.

We use **Spotify AF Valence**, a numerical measure between `0` and `1`:
- **1 → Happy / Cheerful / Positive songs**
- **0 → Sad / Depressing / Angry songs**

### Sample Datasets Included in This Repo

To make this project easier to run, we created **sample versions of the original dataset**:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `data/merged_data_sample.csv` | Small sample from original data |
| `data/merged_data_filtered_sample.csv` | Only Canada + 2017 data |
| `data/merged_data_trimmed_sample.csv` | Unnecessary columns removed |

Full dataset **is not uploaded to GitHub** due to size limits. You can download it from Kaggle.
